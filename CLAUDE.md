# Project Context

This is a workshop project for building something from a brain dump using AI agents.

## Workflow

1. **Plan** - Use the Planner agent to create `plan.md`
2. **Build** - Use the Builder agent to implement Phase 1
3. **Verify** (optional) - Use the Verifier agent for basic tests

## Constraints

- Keep everything local (no auth, payments, or deployments)
- Implement Phase 1 only - resist scope creep
- Prefer simple solutions over clever ones
- Explain commands before asking for permission

## Files

- `plan.md` - The plan created by the Planner agent
- `prompts/` - Agent prompts you can copy/paste or set up as agents

## Commands

After building, the app should run locally. Check `plan.md` for run instructions.
